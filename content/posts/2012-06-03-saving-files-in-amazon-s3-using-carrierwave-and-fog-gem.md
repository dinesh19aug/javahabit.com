Long long time ago in a far far away land&#8230;.. I am just kidding. So I needed a gem to do file uploads(in my case images but you can upload anything) and I was looking at various options. <a title="Paperclip" href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip" target="_blank">Paperclip</a>Â is a popular option but there is a new kid on the block (so i read in various forums)&#8230; <a title="Carrierwave" href="https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave" target="_blank">Carrierwave</a>.

Now I have not used Paperclip but what I read was that <a title="Carrierwave" href="https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave" target="_blank">Carrierwave</a>Â is more flexible and powerful thanÂ <a title="Paperclip" href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip" target="_blank">Paperclip</a>Â so if are interested then keep reading. Now let me tell you that you may need to do some additional settings, I will not get into details because the wiki page ofÂ <a title="Carrierwave" href="https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave" target="_blank">Carrierwave</a>Â is pretty intensive. The purpose of writing this post is to highlight a couple of issue that I ran into and some settings which were not explained.

Step 1: Install the <a title="Carrierwave" href="https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave" target="_blank">Carrierwave</a>Â gem

```
Â  gem install carrierwave**
```
Step 2: Update the gem file
```
gem carrierwave
```
Step 3: Now you need a uploader. This is the file which has all the settings like which folder the image will be saved, setting the image quality, caching etc. I wanted to call my uploader class as **ImageUploader**
```
rails generate uploader ImageUploader
```

Step 4: Install fog gem
```
gem install fog
```

Step 5: Update gem file
```
gem 'fog', ''~> 1.3.1'

bundle install
```

Step 6: Choose the storage type
```ruby
 ImageUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base

Â storage :fog

end
```
Step 7: Create model. Mine was called Photo so I create photo.rb. Notice the line number 10.
```ruby
class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base

#Attributes or fileds

attr_accessible :image,:pic_name,:description,:albums_id

#associations

 belongs_to :albums

#carrier wave
 mount_uploader :image,**ImageUploader**
#Validations
validates :description,:pic_name,:albums_id, :presence=>true
validates_uniqueness_of :pic_name

end
```

Step 7: How to upload file and show uploaded file in the html page

Upload page:
```ruby
<%= form_for @user, :html => {:multipart => true} do |f| >
  <p>
    <label>My Avatar</label>
    <%= f.file_field :avatar >
    <%= f.hidden_field :avatar_cache >
  </p>
<% end >
```
View uploaded image
```
<%= form_for @user, :html => {:multipart => true} do |f| >
  <p>
    <label>My Avatar</label>
    <%= image_tag(@user.avatar_url) if @user.avatar? >
    <%= f.file_field :avatar >
    <%= f.hidden_field :avatar_cache >
  </p>
<% end >
```
Step 8: Now comes the most important part. Setting up fog. Now if you follow the documentation onÂ Â <a title="Carrierwave" href="https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave" target="_blank">Carrierwave</a>Â then you will run into issue(**I will explain the issue and fix below**). The wiki page said create a fileÂ **fog.rbÂ **in the **lib/carrierwave/storage/fog.rbÂ **and that's what I did. I created the file with the contents below.
```ruby
CarrierWave.configure do |config|
  config.fog_credentials = {
    :provider               => 'AWS',       # required
    :aws_access_key_id      => 'xxx',       # required
    :aws_secret_access_key  => 'yyy',       # required
    :region                 => 'eu-west-1'  # optional, defaults to 'us-east-1'
  }
  config.fog_directory  = 'name_of_directory'                     # required
  config.fog_host       = 'https://assets.example.com'            # optional, defaults to nil
  config.fog_public     = false                                   # optional, defaults to true
  config.fog_attributes = {'Cache-Control'=>'max-age=315576000'}  # optional, defaults to {}
end
```
Now before you start you need to have a S3 account on <a title="Amazon S3" href="http://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon S3</a>. So get your Amazon access key and secret access key. For example mine was &#8230;. hehehe no I am not going to share my access keys with you :-). Anyway if you forgot to note down your access key and incase you are wondering where I can find that and are guessing that it will be on S3 Dashboard then you are mistaken just like me. You can find that on your account settings &#8211;> Security credentials.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-579" title="Screen shot 2012-06-03 at 12.26.01 AM" src="http://javahabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/screen-shot-2012-06-03-at-12-26-01-am1.png?w=300" alt=""  />

So after you have noted down your key and access key. Go ahead create a bucket on S3. A bucket is nothing but a directory. It's just a fancy shimancy name for directory that Amazon came up with. You can further create sub directories.

Now coming back to the meaty part and **fog.rbÂ **file. I updated the below fields in the **fog.rb**
```ruby
:aws_access_key_id      => 'xxx',       # required
    :aws_secret_access_key  => 'yyy',       # required
```
I commented out the below lines as they are optional
```ruby
  #:region=> eu-west-1
 Â # optional, defaults to us-east-1

```

I was not sure what was my region so if you are not sure as well then go ahead and comment it.

```ruby
#config.fog_host = https://s3.amazonaws.com'
# optional, defaults to nil

 #config.fog_public = true # optional, defaults to true
```
If you leave
>config.fog_hostÂ to https://s3.amazonaws.com

then I ran into issues which said
```
LoadError (Expected /Users/dinesharora/Desktop/Mydocument/ruby-proj/album/app/uploaders/image_uploader.rb to define ImageUploader):
```
So I commented that field.Â 

The next part that I was not sure about was how to tell fog which folder or directory I want to upload my files. I had created a bucket(directory) called **myalbumsÂ **and had created a sub folder calledÂ devlopment.

So I updated
```
config.fog_directory Â = myalbums/development
```
 which did not work. The right way to do is
```
config.fog_directory Â = myalbums
```
 and also in **ImageUploaderÂ Â **update the line

```
def store_dir
 development/uploads/#{model.class.to\_s.underscore}/#{mounted\_as}/#{model.id}
end
```
That's it. Now just start the server and start uploading, that's what the forums said but as it always happens with me(nothing works for me the first time) I ran into error(as I mentioned earlier that you will if you create the **fog.rb** in lib/carrierwave/storage/ folder) which said
```ruby

**ActionController::RoutingError (uninitialized constant CarrierWave::Storage::Fog):**

 **app/uploaders/image_uploader.rb:11:in \`<class:ImageUploader>'**

 **app/uploaders/image_uploader.rb:3:in \`<top (required)>'**

 **app/models/photo.rb:10:in \`<class:Photo>'**

 **app/models/photo.rb:1:in \`<top (required)>'**

 **app/controllers/photo_controller.rb:1:in \`<top (required)>'**

```
To get rid of this error, just copy the file in **config/initializersÂ **and now I could finally say &#8211; **That's it!!!! ðŸ™‚**

~~~ Cheers!
